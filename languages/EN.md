A easy-to-follow CSS Coding style
---------------------------------

### The overall structure

According to your purpose, continuously, split the large modules into
smaller ones, so that the structure will be clearer.

### Syntax 

Choose a reliable CSS formatting plug-in based on the code editor you
use.

### Declaration order

Copy the following comments and add the corresponding declaration under
each comment:

/\* Positioning \*/

/\* Box-model \*/

/\* Typography \*/

/\* Visual \*/

/\* Misc \*/

### Prefix

According to the code editor used, select a plug-in for automatically
prefixing.

### Shorthand notation

-   Try not to use Shorthand notation to avoid duplicate declaration.

-   At the same time, use auto-complete to save time.

### Media query placement

Place directly after a CSS module, so that the structure is clearer.

### Comments

Add context or describe the purpose.

### Naming

Describe the purpose and use the existing conventions.

### Selectors

To avoid duplication of definitions:

-   Try to use class first.

-   And consider whether it is possible to have a style with only one
    class, and have a style with only one class.
